# JSON sorting 🧰🧑🏾‍💼

Write an application that queries all of the aforementioned endpoints. Design a scenario where a request will be sent several times (up to three times is enough) in case the previous request fails. If there is no response, exclude the result from the output, but print the error in the console. Execute queries sequentially through async/await;
In all received endpoints you need to find the isDone key and find out whether it is True or False.

# Use app 🖥️ 🚀 🚧

Run it:

```bash run
npm start
```
